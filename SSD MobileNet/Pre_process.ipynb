    "The images of bird species provided by our lecturer, Dr. Carl Chalmers, will serve as the input dataset for our project. In total, our professor provided us with approximately 4000 images of four different bird species, from which we were required to tag three unique bird classes with a minimum of 500 tags each class. <br>\n",

    "Because of the differences within these species, I've chosen the three bird species mentioned above to implement my model. The colour of *Erithacus Rubecula* was distinct from the others, while *Pica pica* had a long tail that will aid in identification, and finally *Periparus ater* was similar to Pica pica but with different shades and a shorter tail. These differences will really help my model to train properly. For these reasons, I decided to choose these 3 bird species for my input.<br>\n",
